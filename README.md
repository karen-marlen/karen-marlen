##### I'm a frontend developer who is passionate about making open source more accessible, creating technology to uplift people and build community. Some of the technologies I enjoy working with are Reactjs, Nextjs, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) GraphQL and with different CSS frameworks. 
###### I like design a lot, so I also work with Figma and the Styled System methodology.
